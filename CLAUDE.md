# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

# User Feedback Process

## USER_FEEDBACK.md - Experience Log

This project maintains a living document (`USER_FEEDBACK.md`) that captures raw user experiences and friction points during real-world usage. This log serves as the "discovery phase" that feeds into formal OpenSpec proposals.

**Workflow:**
1. **Capture** - Record immediate reactions while using the app (gut feelings, friction, delight)
2. **Pattern Recognition** - Review periodically to identify recurring themes
3. **Proposal Creation** - When patterns emerge, create OpenSpec proposals to address them
4. **Implementation** - Follow standard OpenSpec process

**Key Principles:**
- Raw reactions before rationalization
- Vague feelings are valid data
- Focus on problems, not solutions
- Chronological to show evolution of understanding
- Low friction to encourage consistent use

See `USER_FEEDBACK.md` for the active log and usage guidelines.
