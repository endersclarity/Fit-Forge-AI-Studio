## Your Point About Biceps

You're absolutely right! Let me recalculate bicep baseline using isolation exercises only:

### Bicep Isolation Exercises (from your data):
- **Concentration Curl**: 3×10 @ 27.5 lb → 825 lb total × 85% = **701 lb**
- **Dumbbell Bicep Curl**: 3×10 @ 30 lb/hand → 1,800 lb total × 72% = **1,296 lb**
- **TRX Bicep Curl**: 3×15 @ ~35% BW → 945 lb total × 65% = **614 lb**

**NEW BICEP BASELINE: 1,296 lb (Dumbbell Bicep Curl)**

This makes way more sense than using TRX Pull-ups (which heavily involve lats and back).

## Would You Like To Add Data For Missing Exercises?

If you have estimates for any of these exercises, we can include them:
- **Dumbbell Shoulder Press** - could give us a better Deltoid baseline
- **Chin-Ups** - another pull-up variation
- **Face Pull** - good for rear delts/rhomboids
- **Dips** (regular) - might be better than TRX Dips for triceps
- etc.

Or should we proceed with the baselines we have and just update Biceps to use Dumbbell Bicep Curl?
