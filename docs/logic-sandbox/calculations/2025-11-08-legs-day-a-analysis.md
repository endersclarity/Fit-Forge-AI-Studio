## 🚨 Critical Issues Found

### 1. Hamstring Baseline Exceeded
**Current Baseline:** 2,880 lbs
**Actual Volume:** 3,258 lbs
**Exceeded By:** 13.1%

**Action Required:** Update hamstring baseline to at least 3,300 lbs based on this workout.

---

### 2. Lower Back Nearly Maxed (94.3%)
**Current Baseline:** 315 lbs
**Actual Volume:** 297 lbs

**Observation:** Lower back is a limiting factor. Only 18 lbs away from baseline.

## 💡 Training Insights

### Volume Distribution
This was a **posterior chain dominant** workout:
- **Hamstrings:** 3,258 lbs (35% of total)
- **Glutes:** 3,390 lbs (36% of total)
- **Lower Back:** 297 lbs (3% of total)

**Total Anterior Chain:** 2,355 lbs (25% of workout)

### Workout Balance
- ✅ Good glute/hamstring balance (3,390 vs 3,258 lbs)
- ⚠️ Low quad volume relative to posterior chain
- ⚠️ Lower back is a bottleneck (94% fatigue)
- ❌ Calves not trained effectively

## 📝 Recommendations

### Immediate (Next 7 Days)
1. **No hamstring work** until Day 7 minimum
2. **No heavy deadlifts** for 6 days (lower back recovery)
3. **Can train upper body** tomorrow (no leg fatigue crossover)
4. **Can train quads** tomorrow if desired (only 14% fatigue)

### Template Improvements
1. **Add weighted calf raises** - Currently no effective calf work
2. **Consider reducing deadlift volume** - Lower back is limiting factor
3. **Add more quad volume** - Only 14% fatigue, room to grow

### Baseline Updates Needed
1. **Hamstrings:** 2,880 lbs → 3,300 lbs (based on actual performance)
2. **Monitor lower back** - May need higher baseline if consistently near max

---

## 📈 Next Steps

1. Update hamstring baseline in `baselines.json`
2. Test upper body workout while legs recover
3. Re-test legs workout after 7 days with updated baseline
4. Consider adding bodyweight multiplier for bodyweight exercises
