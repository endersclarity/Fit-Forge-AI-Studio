# Example Workout: Legs Day A

This document shows an example of how a Legs Day A workout would be logged.

## Workout Details

**Date:** November 8, 2025
**Category:** Legs
**Variation:** A
**Duration:** ~60 minutes
**Template Used:** Legs Day A (with corrections)

## Exercises Performed

### 1. Kettlebell Goblet Squat
- **Equipment:** 40 lb Kettlebell
- **Sets:**
  - Set 1: 40 lbs × 20 reps (to failure)
  - Set 2: 40 lbs × 20 reps (to failure)
  - Set 3: 40 lbs × 20 reps (to failure)
- **Total Volume:** 2,400 lbs (40 × 20 × 3)

## Template Issue Identified

**Problem:** The original Legs Day A template included both:
- `ex12` - Kettlebell Goblet Squat
- `ex43` - Dumbbell Goblet Squat

These are redundant exercises targeting the same movement pattern.

**Solution:** Replace `ex43` (Dumbbell Goblet Squat) with `ex36` (Dumbbell Stiff Legged Deadlift) to add posterior chain work.

## Corrected Template Exercise List

1. `ex12` - Kettlebell Goblet Squat (Quad focus)
2. `ex15` - Calf Raises (Calves)
3. `ex36` - Dumbbell Stiff Legged Deadlift (Hamstrings/Glutes) ✨ **NEW**
4. `ex37` - Kettlebell Swings (Hamstrings/Glutes/Power)

This provides better muscle balance:
- **Quads:** Goblet Squat
- **Calves:** Calf Raises
- **Hamstrings/Glutes:** Stiff Legged Deadlift + Kettlebell Swings

## Expected Personal Records (First Time)

Since this would be the first time logging these exercises:
- **Kettlebell Goblet Squat:** 800 lbs (40 × 20)
- **Calf Raises:** Bodyweight
- **Kettlebell Swings:** 800 lbs (40 × 20)
- **Dumbbell Stiff Legged Deadlift:** 1,500 lbs (100 × 15)
